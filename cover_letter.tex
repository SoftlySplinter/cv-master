%	LETTER CONTENT
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am writing to apply for the position of Advisor as discussed over email. Please find attached a copy of my CV.

%PARAGRAPH ONE: State the reason for the letter, name the position or type of work you are applying for and identify the source from which you learned of the opening (i.e. career development centre, newspaper, employment service, personal contact).


I am applying for this position as I am a good teacher with an approachable demeanour which will make me a good fit for the role of Advisor. I am used to answering questions both in person and on internet-based forums such as the Aber CompSci Q\&A facebook group. I enjoy both helping and teaching people of all ages, as evidenced by several points in my attached CV, and would revel in the chance to do this in a more formal setting within the department.

I have already taught in the department as a demonstrator in 2011-12 and was praised as an ``excellent'' demonstrator by students, which was fed back to me by the Staff Student Committee. I also attended a peer review of teaching of all demonstrators and provided feedback on how to improve the demonstration of practical sessions.

Having taught a variety of subjects in several differing environments to many audiences, I have developed good communication skills to be able to explain topics in an easily understandable manner. Having qualified as a Kayaking Instructor I have also learnt about different teaching styles. This allows me to adjust my teaching to better suit a students preferred learning style.

I have also produced and presented a publication for an IEEE-sponsored Image and Signal Processing conference for a special session on Digital Imaging in Cultural Heritage. I have also presented the topic of this paper: dating the work of the Welsh artist Sir John ``Kyffin'' Williams using image processing, at two BSc Show and Tell events, gaining good feedback from several attendees.

I am currently working at a first/high 2:1, with notable modules including: ``Major Project'' (78\%), ``Open Source Development Issues'' (75\%) and ``Agile Methodologies'' (71\%) in the third year. ``The Artificial Intelligence Toolbox Part I: How To Find Solutions'' (82\%), ``Program Design, Data Structure and Algorithms'' (76\%) and Modelling Persistent Data'' (80\%).

I have acted as a duty instructor at Adur Canoe Club kayaking sessions on several occasions, leading groups of novice kayakers with the aid of other, more experienced kayakers. I also acted as the clubs webmaster between 2009 and 2010, maintaining and updating the clubs website (http://adurcanoeclub.org.uk), as well as attending monthly committee meetings to help run and improve the club as a whole.

During my year at IBM I had many responsibilities, including the continuing improvement of the agile-based team management server Rational Team Concert (RTC). This involved building plug-ins to improve the day-to-day usage of RTC for the team as well as updating the way the team used RTC. This included meeting with other teams in the Hursley site to discuss their plug-ins to evaluate the compatibility with my own teams usage of RTC. This was taken further with discussions to have a site-wide standardised tool for performing a major operation required by all Level 3 service teams, which involved the gathering of requirements from high-ranking members of my own team.

I was also assigned as part of a small team to organise and run the inductions for the 2012-13 intake of new industrial trainees in technical roles for IBM. This comprised of booking rooms within the Hursley site in which to hold the inductions, getting approval from each of the trainees managers to set up and supply them with the required equipment for their role, getting speakers from upper- and middle-management to perform introductions and education during each induction. For my efforts in this role I was congratulated by both the lead manager of the industrial trainees and the lab director for the Hursley site.

Please feel free to contact me by email (adb9@aber.ac.uk) or telephone (07575579840) if you would like any more information. You can also visit my website (http://alexanderdbrown.com) or my blog\\ (http://blog.alexanderdbrown.com) to view some of my online portfolio.

%PARAGRAPH TWO: Indicate why you are interested in the position, the company, its products, services - above all, stress what you can do for the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain how your academic background makes you a qualified candidate for the position. If you have practical work experience, point out specific achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat the same information the reader will find in the resume. Refer the reader to the enclosed resume or application which summarizes your qualifications, training, and experiences. The purpose of this section is to strengthen your resume by providing details which bring your experiences to life. 
 
%PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and indicate your flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For example, state that you will be in the city where the company is located on a certain date and would like to set up an interview. Alternatively, state that you will call on a certain date to set up an interview. End the letter by thanking the employer for taking time to consider your credentials.
