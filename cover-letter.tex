%	LETTER CONTENT
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


%PARAGRAPH ONE: State the reason for the letter, name the position or type of work you are applying for and identify the source from which you learned of the opening (i.e. career development centre, newspaper, employment service, personal contact).

I am applying for the role of Internal Job Engineer as described through our recent conversations.

%PARAGRAPH TWO: Indicate why you are interested in the position, the company, its products, services - above all, stress what you can do for the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain how your academic background makes you a qualified candidate for the position. If you have practical work experience, point out specific achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat the same information the reader will find in the resume. Refer the reader to the enclosed resume or application which summarizes your qualifications, training, and experiences. The purpose of this section is to strengthen your resume by providing details which bring your experiences to life. 

% TODO quick whistle stop tour
Having published and presented a paper at an IEEE conference and earning the
Portaltech Reply Bursary in Computer Science for best performance in the
penultimate year of the Software Engineering MEng course, I am a capable
developer with experience in developing in-house tools and contributing to
open source projects.

% You are comfortable with a wide range of technologies and languages (our core languages are C++, Scala, Java, PHP, and server-side JavaScript; you may also have Python or Ruby)
Examples of my work are available on GitHub 
(\url{https://github.com/SoftlySplinter/}). 
%	Python experience; both functional and OO elements, OpenCV, Flask, PyPi, unittest2, etc.
%	Java experience; OSGi, Eclipse, Android, some EE
%	Limited C experience, less so with C++; standard GCC libraries
%	Investigated Scala, Ruby, Node.js

% You have a solid Computer Science or Software Engineering background 
%	Degree - achieving high marks
I am already achieving high marks from the coursework submitted for masters
level modules, as well as already having achieved high marks from my final
project, which also led to the aforementioned paper.

This project focused on dating the work of the Welsh artist Kyffin Williams 
using catalogue photographs with known dates. This involved using image 
processing techniques to analyse this pictures and classify a new example based
on the existing work.

% You are comfortable creating and maintaining in-house test tools, platforms and environments from scratch
% 	CICS L3 Service Tooling (not testing, but synonymous)
In my role at IBM I was responsible for creating and maintaining in-house tools and 
platforms, which aided the jobs of both members of the CICS L3 Service team and members
of CICS management, through the automated gathering of statistics and the 
improvement or automation of regularly performed tasks.

% You are comfortable working on full-stack solutions, including the creating of virtual machines and the provisioning of machines
%	VPS Management
During this time at IBM I worked closely with a CentOS Server running DB2 and a WebSphere 
Application Server, which ran some of the in-house tools. I have also managed a
personal VPS which runs Nginx to provide web-based content and have previous
hosted Flask-based Python applications using the WSGI module.

%	Played with Vagrant during the code test
Although I have not had a huge amount of experience provisioning and creating 
virtual machines, I was able to quickly learn the basics of Vagrant during the
programming exercise I completed in November, and have continued to use and 
explore the features Vagrant provides. %TODO blag this less.

% You have a passion for automating complex activities, and are drawn to the challenge of ensuring that nothing has to be done manually
%	CICS L3 Automation
A main role in my job at IBM was to automate a lot of the end-to-end process 
used to deliver fix packs of CICS Eclipse-based products. This system pulled
information from servers used to develop the fix packs, package it in a way 
which the update servers would recognise and then deliver the pack.
This system also allowed these elements to be scripted in a simple language so
the developers could further automate this process.

This system involved digging into a lot of the external APIs to figure how
certain parameters were used and how they would affect the delivery of the fix
packs.

%	Shell scripting
%	Travis integration
I am also versed at using shell scripts to automate some of the mundane tasks
I perform day-to-day, such as automatically pulling university notes from an
online editor and then pushing these notes into a git repository. I'm also
used to compiling code through the use of build tools such as GNU make or 
Python setup tools. I have also set up Travis integration with some projects to
provide automated testing against different runtimes.


% You enjoy getting under the skin of something, and figuring out the ramifications of complex interactions
%	Dissertation
%	Uni modules
In my most recent job as Advisor at Aberystwyth University, it is one of my 
responsibilities to help students in lower years with their programming 
assignments. This is often a matter of debugging through their code and 
figuring out how it fits together, to then work out where their error is
occurring and how it might be fixed without large changes being made.

% You look to prove what is actually happening rather than work off assumptions
%	Tend to run to ensure behaviour is expected. Tending to expand this to automated testing through Travis for some GitHub projects (c-armok, etc.)

% You can take ownership of a tool and lead its development and direction
%	IBM examples

% You can react quickly and confidently to urgent situations
%	Teaching
%	Kayaking

% You are comfortable creating and maintaining tools for a service-oriented architecture
%	??? Probably IBM

% You are comfortable working within lightweight processes where the code under development is the main reference point for testing requirements
%	???

% You are comfortable working on Linux on the server, and either Linux or OS X on the desktop
I am a competent Linux user, both for desktop and server use. I also talk at 
and help organise events for the West Wales Linux Users Group.
%	Currently run Linux on all machines, preferred OS.
%	VPS
%	Other server management

% Ability to collaborate with and enjoy a small, intense team of engineers and business people in a world-leading company
%	Worked in many teams, mostly small groups.
Developed a game based on the travelling salesman problem which would introduce
school children to the concepts of mathematics and artificial agents for the
Blue Fusion event held at IBM Hursley. During this process I often had to 
control the quality of the code being committed and fix problems others 
encountered.

%	Open Source Experience
I have worked as part of an online group of artists improving the art for the
open source game \textit{Battle for Wesnoth}. I have also worked as part of a small 
group contributing to the open source project \textit{pytentd}.

% Strong verbal and written communication skills
%	Presentations and teaching
I have presented the subject of my dissertation; dating an artists work from 
catalogue photographs; at both the ISPA Conference and at the BSc Show and 
Tell.

I have also led a team of IBMers in organising and running a Java Masterclass
at Swanmore School of Technology, often presenting the session content myself.
I also ran other Java teaching sessions for IBMers with different programming
backgrounds.

% Scrupulous attention to detail and addicted to quality
%	???

% Ready to take responsibility and go the extra yard to hit a deadline
%	Blue Fusion

 
%PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and indicate your flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For example, state that you will be in the city where the company is located on a certain date and would like to set up an interview. Alternatively, state that you will call on a certain date to set up an interview. End the letter by thanking the employer for taking time to consider your credentials. 

Thank you for taking the time to consider my application.
