Currently achieving a mark of a first/high 2:1 after four years of study, including a single year of industry at IBM Hursley.

Produced a highly marked (78\%) third year project entitled ``Kyffin Williams: Digital Analysis of Paintings'', which also resulted in a paper for the \textbf{8\textsuperscript{th} International Symposium on Image and Signal Process and Analysis (ISPA)} entitled ``Can we date an artists work from catalogue photographs?'' 

This paper was later presented at the conference in Trieste on 3\textsuperscript{rd} September, 2013 and was co-authored with the project supervisor, Hannah Dee; a PhD student at the Aberystwyth School of Art, Gareth Lloyd Roderick; and a Professor of Digital Humanities at the National Library of Wales, Lorna M. Hughes.

This third year project was also presented twice at the British Computer Society (BCs) Show and Tell event twice at Aberystwyth University, gaining good feedback from members of the audience including members of staff in the Computer Science department

Volunteered as part of the Technocamps project at the university, teaching school children aged 11-15 year basic electronics and programming for them to be able to build semi-automated robots.

Good knowledge of program design, architecture, data structures and algorithms with high marks in modules relating to these topics, including ``C and UNIX Programming'' (70\%), ``Program Design, Data Structures and Algorithms'' (76\%) and ``Developing Internet-Based Applications'' (70\%).

\ressubheading{IBM}{IBM Hursley}{CICS Level 3 Service Tooling Engineer}{2012-2013}
\vspace{10pt}

Responsible for designing and developing useful Java-based tools for the CICS Level 3 Service team, including an eclipse plug-in to print out information required for code reviews and a large system to automate the delivery of fix patches for CICS Eclipse-based products, which hooked into many internal systems.

Helped gather requirements to apply to a system designed to be used by all Level 3 Service teams so that the CICS team would not be disrupted in their work and attended meeting to discuss the development of this system.

Maintained and improved several systems for generating statistics for problem reports and the processes for fixing these problems, including a Java Enterprise server and DB2 database hosted on a CentOS Enterprise Linux server.

Lead a team of three IBM employees to run a Java-master at Swanmore School of Technology, to get school children aged 13-15 years introduced to programming in the Java programming language at a basic level.

Helped teach several Java sessions internally within IBM to help members of the Level 3 CICS Service team and Industrial Trainees gain the skills and knowledge needed to use Java in their jobs. Mentored by an ex-lecturer from the University of Southampton to help decide the content of these sessions and the teaching style involved.

Organised the inductions for the 2012-13 intake of Industrial Trainees for their first two days at IBM, requiring the networking with both managers of each trainee to ensure they had the equipment and logins for their roles, as well as members of upper-management to present introductory talks at each of the three inductions. This was done as part of a team of three, with the help of industrial trainee and graduate managers.

Responsible for the sign-off of assessed worksheets in the practical sessions for the ``Introduction to Computer Operating Systems, Hardware and UNIX Tools'' and ``Software Development'' first year modules. The first of the modules focused on the use of the UNIX command-line environment and the second of these modules taught development of Java applications, particularly GUI-based applications using the swing libraries and multi-threaded programming paradigms.

In the December 2011 Staff Student Committee Meeting I was praised as an ``excellent'' demonstrator.

Contributed to the peer observation of teaching for demonstrators, giving feedback on how to improve the teaching methods of demonstrators and to improve the process of the demonstration of practical sessions.

\item[Teaching] \hfill \\
Qualified British Canoe Union (BCU) Level 2 Kayaking Instructor. Ran a number of sessions as the duty instructor for Adur Canoe Club, as well as supporting other instructors as part of their duty sessions, involving teaching kayakers of a wide range of ages and skill levels the skills required to improve their paddling.

\item[Communication and Presentation] \hfill \\
Attended presentation workshops in the business centre of IBM Hursley to improve presentation skills with the aid of professional presenters.

Presented a range of topics to several audiences including the findings of a paper at a conference, the teaching of computer science and kayaking techniques and the application image processing techniques at the BSc Show and Tell.

Announced and moderated talks at the Free and Open Source Developers Meet (FOSDEM) in Brussels, Belgium.

\item[Computing] \hfill \\
Good knowledge of the Java programming language (versions 1.6 and 1.7) having attended sessions to become certified in Java 7 and produced many Java projects, including a large scale system which hooked into several other systems using varying APIs, a simulation of flocking behaviour and a game to teach children mathematical and technological concepts by programming an agent to visit locations in the shortest distance.

Good knowledge of the UNIX/Linux command-line, having demonstrated the topic and having managed several servers both personal and within IBM.
